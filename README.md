Created a very simple Rock Paper Scissors game using html, css, and javascript
Simply choose which of the 3 to use and the computer will randomly choose. First to 5 points wins.
The 3 buttons are displayed using html with very simple design using css
Javascript was used in playing the game, storing input from the button, computer choice, storing the current score, displaying the round output below the buttons, and announcement of winner
